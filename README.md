## Project Proposal

Finding a movie to watch can be a dilemma. People looking for entertainment certainly know that interests them, but not necessarily which movies fit the bill.

Someone may be interested in certain movies due to internet buzz or friends' recommendations, but they are unsure if it is something that they enjoy.


I am proposing a movie library tool, similar to the book library tools such as Goodreads.


The system will import a collection of available movies and provide the user the ability to search, sort, collect, review and save information to their personal collections.

Perhaps the user would create different wish lists for different occasions (date night, best sports movies ever) and need to be able to filter through thousands of titles to find candidates they can add to their wish lists.

    - The library tool should be able to find similar movies based on various attributes to recommend to the user while they search.
    - User accounts and lists must be persisted. In other words, a user should not lose their data when they shut down the system and restart it.
    - The system needs a GUI (Graphical User Interface) that allows user to log in, view their collections, create/edit/remove collections, search the movie data in a variety of ways (by people, genres, rated, etc.).
    - The GUI should consider ease of use for the user as an important factor.
    - Data should be displayed neatly organized with appealing layouts and images.
    - The GUI should use intuitive, easy to understand actions and controls, such as buttons, checkboxes, drop down selections and drag-and-drop.
    - The system does not have any audio components.
    - The backend data for this project will be stored in a JSON formatted file.
    - It will include the mentioned fields of interest, as well as several more.
    - The data will include links to images stored either locally or on the internet for display purposes.
    - There needs to be a way for the system to be configured to find/store that file's location for repeated use by the system on launch.

References relative to JSON:

I will provide 1 or more suitable java libraries for parsing json text, later.
